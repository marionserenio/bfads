			<h2>2012 Appliance Black Friday Buying Guide</h2>
			<p>There will undoubtedly be hordes of people lining up for laptops and HDTV’s the night before Black Friday. Depending on the 
			earlier sales dates, some may even camp out on the morning of Thanksgiving. As we’ve said, electronics are the first category 
			that comes to mind when people think of Black Friday. Dollar for dollar, some of the best Black Friday savings can actually be 
			found on appliances, some of which features price cuts as steep as 60% off MSRP.
			<br>
			<br>
			Although appliances seem like a boring buy, they’re important additions to any home. Some may even be used daily. Sure, they’re 
			a bit more of an investment than a budget tablet or laptop, but they’re also supposed to last for years to come. Keep that in 
			mind when evaluating these deals – though the initial price may seem high, take a look at the MSRP. The savings is often several 
			hundred dollars. Some can even crack 1,000 in savings. 
			<br>
			<br>
			Read on to see our Black Friday highlights in a handful of different appliance categories.
